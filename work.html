        <p>
          My work experience mainly consists of customer service and
          hospitality. Although I’ve always wanted to teach, I was too busy
          throughout college to tutor or substitute so I took up various serving
          jobs at different restaurants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am working at a fine dining wine and steakhouse while
          also doing freelance Spanish interpreting. Before this, I worked as a
          teller at a bank, and also as a dispatcher for the Washington Dulles
          Airport.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it comes to my college education, I took the general required
          credits for my first two years, and when I became an English major, I
          chose Literature as my concentration. I took various African American
          and Literature classes, Latino Literature Classes, Creative Writing,
          Literary Theory, and varying Literature classes from different time
          period.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I got into graduate school, I also pursued English Literature but
          I got to take different classes such as poetry, Native American
          Literature, and British Literature.
