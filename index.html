        <h3>Brief Overview:</h3>
        <p>
          I am a 26 year old graduate student, completing my last semester at
          <b>George Mason</b>. My favorite witting period is anything 18th
          century and early 19th century. My favorite writer is
          <b>Ernest Hemingway</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I live in <i>Loudoun County, Virginia</i> and I am also a mom and dog
          mom. My son is 1 year old and we have a new puppy. She is a mini red
          Goldendoodle and her name is <strong>Mei Mei</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from reading and writing, what I love most is to travel. I had
          always traveled since I was very young especially after I move to the
          <b>United States from Cali, Colombia</b>. Since the age of 5, I don't
          remember being scared of airplanes but instead feeling exciting.
          Looking out of the window and seeing city lights right before landing
          was the highlight of every trip.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would travel almost every summer to Colombia, and once there, my
          grandfather would always take me to the nearby cities to explore new
          food spots, enjoy street vendor shopping, and see new landscapes and
          animals. I would often write throughout all of my travels. And when I
          turned 18, I decided I wanted to travel alone to many more places. For
          my high school graduation, my mother paid for me to visit Brazil
          during the 2014 world cup. I can't believe it's already been 10 years!
