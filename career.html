        My goal was to become a teacher. I wanted to teach secondary education
        and be an English Teacher either in <em>Loudoun County</em> or in
        <em>Fairfax County.</em>
        I wanted to get my master’s degree so I could also teach AP classes as
        well as dual enrollment. I would also like to teach summer school and
        become an adjunct part-time at a nearby community college. I think that
        teaching would be very fulfilling because I will get to influence future
        minds and give back to my community. Most recently, I accepted a
        position as an English teacher at a middle school nearby and I’m very
        excited to start my new job. The cover letter that I used to obtain my
        position was this one.

          Dear Hiring Team, I am interested in obtaining the available position
          as a 6-12 English teacher because reading and writing are my passion.
          Working with Loudoun County Public Schools would not only help me in
          advancing my career but it would also give me the opportunity of
          becoming more well versed in student/ teacher interactions as well as
          allowing me to give back to my community. Specifically, this position
          would give me the opportunity to share my knowledge with others and be
          able to discuss subjects in literature which I am passionate about.
          Working for LCPS would be an extremely exciting way of providing a
          crucial service to young kids and helping them shape a worldview where
          the humanities is a key part. Currently, I am attending my second to
          last semester of my master’s degree in English with a concentration in
          literature at George Mason University. During my time at George Mason,
          I have taken several courses towards my English major including
          Linguistics, Grammar, Synthesis, Fiction Writing, and various
          literature courses ranging from science fiction, to poetry, and even
          autobiography. Throughout my school years I have been thrust into
          different types of learning environments as well as varied content and
          genres, so I feel that I have the flexible mindset and mentality that
          will allow me to adapt to different educational needs. Prior to Mason,
          I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a bachelor’s degree in English from
          the University of South Florida in Tampa. In relation to my job
          experience, most recently I have been working as a Spanish interpreter
          for Lionbridge since I am a Native Spanish speaker. Lionbridge has
          provided me with a fastpaced working environment where multi-tasking
          and precision are essential. Every interpretation call is unique in
          that it can range from medical settings to court room hearings to
          healthcare applications, among many. I also have almost 9 years of
          customer service experience which makes me feel confident that I will
          be an asset to the county. Thank you for your time, Laura Chavez
          Medina
